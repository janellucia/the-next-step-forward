                                    the market. Once sold, Clare helped us decide what to keep/donate/dispose/sell – and as a huge bonus, she sold items we did not want on maxsold. We made more money than we thought. Clare helped us pack, hired movers
                                    and managed our move! It made for a stress-free, enjoyable experience. I highly recommend using her services for all stages of your downsizing and moving. It was worth every penny! Thanks Clare!

                                    a moving company which came in advance to see the set up in my condo’s garage with Clare there to make sure it all worked out. And then Clare and her associates came and packed up my precious china, crystal and art.
                                    They were a delight and worked very efficiently. I highly recommend their services.

                                    I required and were very helpful when I had to make tough decisions about what should go. They packed up so many items quickly and efficiently and then removed them and delivered everything to suitable sites at the
                                    end of each day. The whole experience was professional, I would highly recommend TNSF!

                                    and details needed for which items were to stay and go and we had absolutely no issues. Her packing and labelling so that we know what is packed where when we return to the country or arrange for items to move out of
                                    country was seamless. Quote was accurate and speed was amazing
